## Getting Started

### Option 1: Docker One-Click Deployment

For the easiest setup experience, use our Docker one-click deployment:

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
   - Git to clone the repository

2. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zguiyang/bookmark.git
   cd bookmark
   ```

3. **Run the deployment script**

   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Application: http://localhost:13092 (After deployment with deploy.sh, this is the only address you need to access)
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:13092/api-docs/

   > Note: The backend and frontend services are not directly accessible from outside the Docker network. All traffic is routed through the Nginx proxy on port 13092.

> The deployment script (`deploy.sh`) will automatically perform the following tasks:
> 
> - Check for Docker and Docker Compose dependencies
> - Create necessary configuration files (docker-compose.yaml, .env, etc.)
> - Generate secure random passwords for MongoDB, Redis, and authentication
> - Configure environment variables for both frontend and backend services
> - Build and start all required containers
> - Save all credentials to a file named `bookmark-credentials.txt` for your reference
> 
> **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE**: Both the `bookmark-credentials.txt` and `.env` files contain sensitive information including database credentials and authentication secrets. These files are automatically added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. You should:
>
> - Keep a secure backup of these files
> - Never commit these files to version control
> - Restrict access to these files on your server
> - Consider using a password manager for production credentials
>
> The deployment script also creates environment files for both frontend and backend with proper configuration. These files also contain sensitive information and should be properly secured.

#### Docker Deployment Details

##### Configuration Files

- `docker-compose.example.yaml`: Template configuration file
- `Dockerfile`: Unified multi-stage Dockerfile for the entire Monorepo project
- `apps/web/.env.production`: Frontend environment variables
- `backend/.env.production`: Backend environment variables

##### Customizable Variables

The following variables can be customized in the deployment script (`deploy.sh`):

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `DB_NAME` | `bookmark` | MongoDB database name |
| `DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE` | `docker-compose.yaml` | Docker Compose configuration file name |
| `DOCKER_COMPOSE_EXAMPLE` | `docker-compose.example.yaml` | Template Docker Compose file |
| `ENV_FILE` | `.env` | Main environment variables file |
| `BACKEND_ENV_FILE` | `backend/.env.production` | Backend environment configuration file |
| `FRONTEND_ENV_FILE` | `apps/web/.env.production` | Frontend environment configuration file |
| `CREDENTIALS_FILE` | `bookmark-credentials.txt` | File to store generated credentials |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | `13091` | Backend service port |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | `13090` | Frontend service port |

**Important Note**: When deploying, pay special attention to the following environment variables:
- Database connection strings
- JWT secrets
- API keys
- OAuth configuration settings

These variables contain sensitive information and should be properly secured.

You can modify these variables directly in the `deploy.sh` file before running it, or override the port variables using environment variables as described in the [Customizing Ports](#customizing-ports) section.

##### Monorepo Architecture and Docker Build

This project uses a Monorepo architecture with a unified Docker build process:

- The unified `Dockerfile` handles building shared packages, frontend, and backend in a single build process
- Multi-stage builds are used to create optimized production images
- Shared packages in the `packages/` directory are built first and then used by both frontend and backend

##### Data Persistence

Application data is stored in Docker volumes:

- `mongo-data`: MongoDB data
- `redis-data`: Redis data
- `backend-uploads`: Uploaded files

##### Production Deployment Considerations

1. **Security**:

   - Change all default passwords
   - Consider using Docker Secrets for sensitive information
   - Restrict container network access

2. **Performance**:

   - Adjust container resource limits based on server capacity
   - Use production-grade configurations for MongoDB and Redis

3. **Reliability**:

   - Set up container health checks
   - Configure automatic restart policies
   - Implement backup strategies

4. **HTTPS**:
   - Configure HTTPS in production environments
   - Consider using Nginx as a reverse proxy with SSL

##### OAuth Login Configuration

To enable OAuth login functionality, you need to configure the following environment variables:

1. **Google OAuth**:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Your Google OAuth client ID
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Google OAuth client secret
   - `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL`: The callback URL for Google OAuth (e.g., `http://localhost:13091/auth/google/callback`)

2. **GitHub OAuth**:
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: Your GitHub OAuth client ID
   - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your GitHub OAuth client secret
   - `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL`: The callback URL for GitHub OAuth (e.g., `http://localhost:13091/auth/github/callback`)

You can obtain these credentials by creating OAuth applications in the respective developer consoles:
- Google: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- GitHub: [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)

### Option 2: Manual Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start development**

   ```bash
   # Start both frontend and backend
   pnpm dev

   # Frontend only
   pnpm web:dev

   # Backend only
   pnpm backend:dev
   ```

3. **Build & Production**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm start
   ```

## Docker Management Commands

```bash
# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the application
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart a specific service
docker-compose restart [service_name]

# Rebuild and start services
docker-compose up -d --build

# Stop and remove volumes (will delete all data!)
docker-compose down -v
```

### Customizing Ports

You can customize the ports used by the application:

1. **Using environment variables during deployment**:

   ```bash
   # Example: Use custom ports
   NGINX_PORT=8080 FRONTEND_PORT=4000 BACKEND_PORT=9000 ./deploy.sh
   ```

   > Note: After deployment, you will only access the application through the NGINX_PORT (default: 13092).
   > The FRONTEND_PORT and BACKEND_PORT are only used internally within the Docker network.

2. **Manually editing configuration files**:
   - Edit port values in `deploy.sh`
   - Update port mappings in `docker-compose.yaml`
   - Update environment variables in `.env.production` files

### Troubleshooting

- **Container fails to start**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs [service_name]`
- **Database connection issues**: Verify environment variables in `.env` and `.env.production` files
- **Port conflicts**: Change port mappings in `docker-compose.yaml` if ports are already in use, or use the environment variables as described above
